### Bind enrollment certificates to the Agent Identity

Enrollment rejects Agent identifiers and certificate requests that do not match
the protected Ed25519 identity. Certificate issuance and renewal reject incorrect
subjects, missing SANs, additional names, and duplicate names.
The Agent validates the full certificate chain against its pinned CA root and
stores the verified intermediate chain for mutual TLS. A CA response cannot
replace the pinned root.

Certificate names now come from the Agent Identity. Remove
`managedGateway.certificate.stepCa.authorizedSans` from Helm values and
`step_ca_authorized_sans` from a Controller configuration before upgrading an
existing step-ca deployment.
